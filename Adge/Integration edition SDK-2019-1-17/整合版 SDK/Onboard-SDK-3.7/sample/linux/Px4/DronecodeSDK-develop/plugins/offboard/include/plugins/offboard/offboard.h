/**
 * @brief This class is used to control a drone with velocity commands.
 *
 * The module is called offboard because the velocity commands can be sent from external sources
 * as opposed to onboard control right inside the autopilot "board".
 *
 * Client code must specify a setpoint before starting offboard mode.
 * DronecodeSDK automatically resends setpoints at 20Hz (PX4 Offboard mode requires that setpoints
 * are minimally resent at 2Hz). If more precise control is required, clients can call the setpoint
 * methods at whatever rate is required.
 *
 * **Attention:** this is work in progress, use with caution!
